# Jr. Frontend Engineer coding test

Create a simple application or static site that serves a case study page similar to Percolate’s current client case study template. Examples can be found at [percolate.com/clients](https://percolate.com/clients/), such as the [Unilever Case Study](https://percolate.com/clients/unilever) and the [Amtrak Case Study](https://percolate.com/clients/amtrak).

Make the following changes to the case study layout:

1. Add items to the “results” section to make that section a total of six images and paragraphs. (Currently, the case study pages feature two or four items.)
1. Build a responsive layout so that the “results” section is one column on mobile, two columns on tablet, and three columns on desktop.
1. 

Deploy or host the application somewhere and create a GitHub repo for it. Send us a URL to the live site and your GitHub repo.


## Dev guidelines

- If you decide to use a backend framework, choose a JavaScript-, PHP-, or Python-based framework
- Strong preference for styling with a CSS preprocessor such as Sass

## Evaluation criteria

1. The structure and approach to how you built the app
1. A working form that emails on submission and displays an error in the case of incomplete or invalid content
1. Responsive layout
1. A polished user experience on the site
1. Bonus points for creativity to improve the user experience


## Notes

- Feel free to link to or copy existing static files on our site or on our CDN.
- Don’t worry too much about the content, we’ll be evaluating the layout and your work. Feel free to use “lorem ipsum” copy (or, you know, [Space Ipsum](http://spaceipsum.com/) or [whatever ipsum you want](http://mashable.com/2013/07/11/lorem-ipsum/)) and other placeholder images for the case study content.
- If necessary, document how to get the site running locally in a README in the repo.
