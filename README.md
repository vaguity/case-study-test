Create a simple application or static site that serves a case study page similar to Percolate’s current case study template. If you use a framework, JavaScript, PHP, or Python would be preferred for the backend.

The case study can be for a real or fictional brand, just not one we already have a page for. Examples can be found at [percolate.com/clients](https://percolate.com/clients/), such as the [Unilever Case Study](https://percolate.com/clients/unilever) and the [Amtrak Case Study](https://percolate.com/clients/amtrak).

Add items to the “results” section to make that section a total of six images and paragraphs. (Currently, the case study pages feature two or four items.) The section should be one column on mobile, two columns on tablet, and three columns on desktop. Strong preference for styling with a CSS preprocessor such as Sass.

Build your own form in the “See Percolate in Action” section. The page should display an error if the form is submitted incomplete or incorrectly. On a successful submission, you should email the user the following:

	[First Name],

	Thanks for requesting a demo! We’ll get back to you soon.

Deploy or host the application somewhere and create a GitHub repo for it. Send us a URL to the live site and your GitHub repo.


## Evaluation criteria

1. The structure and approach to how you built the app
1. A working form that emails on submission and displays an error in the case of incomplete or invalid content
1. Responsive layout
1. Polish with regard to the user experience on the site
1. Bonus points for creativity to improve the user experience


## Notes

- Feel free to link to or copy existing static files on our site or on our CDN.
- Don’t worry too much about the content, we’ll be evaluating the layout and your work. Feel free to use “lorem ipsum” copy or other placeholder images for the case study content.
- If necessary, document how to get the site running locally in a README in the repo.
