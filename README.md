# Jr. Frontend Engineer coding test

Create a simple application or static site that serves a case study page similar to Percolate’s current client case study template. Examples can be found at [percolate.com/clients](https://percolate.com/clients/), such as the [Unilever Case Study](https://percolate.com/clients/unilever) and the [Amtrak Case Study](https://percolate.com/clients/amtrak).

Make the following changes to the case study layout:

1. Add a styled link with the text “See the Results” below the page title and within the hero image section that seamlessly scrolls the user down to the “Results” section
1. Add items to the “results” section to make that section a total of eight images and paragraphs. (Currently, the case study pages feature two or four items.)
1. Build a responsive layout so that the “results” section is one column on mobile, two columns on tablet, and three columns on desktop.
1. Replace the form at the bottom of the page with a styled link that reveals a modal dialog which includes the form. (The form doesn't need to work.) The modal dialog should:
    1. Be centered horizontally and vertically
    1. Darken the page behind it
    1. Include a close button
    1. Close when the user hits "escape"
    1. Prevent the user from scrolling on the page behind it

Deploy or host the application somewhere and create a GitHub repo for it. Send us a URL to the live site and your GitHub repo.

Include some notes with your thinking about how you built the page. This can be included in a README or as inline comments throughout your code. Especially note and explain use of third-party tools and why you included them.


## Dev guidelines

- If you decide to use a backend framework, choose a JavaScript-, PHP-, or Python-based framework.
- Strong preference for styling with a CSS preprocessor such as Sass.
- Feel free to link to or copy existing static files on our site or on our CDN.
- Don’t worry about the content, we’ll be evaluating the layout and your work. Use “lorem ipsum” copy and placeholder images for the case study content.
- If necessary, document how to get the site running locally in a README in the repo.
- This test should take you no longer than four hours. Feel free to break up that time over a couple of coding sessions.


## Evaluation criteria

1. The structure and approach to how you built the app
1. Semantic markup
1. Responsive layout
1. A polished, on-brand user experience
1. Thoughtful use of any tools or third-party libraries
1. Bonus points for creativity to improve the user experience
